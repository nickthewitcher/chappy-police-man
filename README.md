# Chappy Police Man

We listen daily to different events of citizen insecurity that unfortunately occur in our country and we know that we could be part of the statistics. Our authorities, despite doing their best to combat this situation, is not enough.
When these events occur, we seek prompt help from our police, however, our reporting system is manual, bureaucratic and cumbersome, this generates a loss of vital time to take action and in many cases, the report is not specified.
This is how Chappy is your friend bot, which seeks to eliminate all those barriers and be the bridge that allows us to simplify this search for help.

## How we build it

After brainstorming, we finally opted for the idea of helping people connect with the police service quickly and easily through an interactive chat.
For that, we support ourselves with the following technologies:

1. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
2. Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
3. i18n: Lightweight simple translation module with dynamic json storage
4. Pdfkit: PDF document generation library for Node and the browser that makes creating complex, multi-page, printable documents easy.
5. Original Coast Clothing: Is a Messenger bot for a fictional clothing brand created to showcase key features of the Messenger Platform. 
6. Facebook API: Set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating Facebook into your apps.
## Requirements

- **Facebook Page:** Will be used as the identity of your messaging experience. When people chat with your page. To create a new Page, visit https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.
- **Facebook Developer Account:** Required to create new apps, which are the core of any Facebook integration. You can create a new developer account by going to the [Facebook Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/) and clicking the "Get Started" button.
